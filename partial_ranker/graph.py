class Graph:
    """Class to represent the dependencies of the objects as a transitively reduced directed acyclic graph.
    
    Inputs:
        **deps (dict[str, list[str]])**: Dictionary with nodes as keys and a list of nodes that it depends on as values.
            
            - e.g.; if dependency is based on a better-than relation, then in deps that look like ``{'obj1': ['obj2', 'obj3], 'obj2': ['obj4'], ...}``, ``obj2`` and ``obj3`` are better than ``obj1``, ``obj4`` is better than ``obj2``, etc.

        **depths (dict[int,List[str]])**: A dictionary consisting of the list of objects at each rank.
            
            - e.g.; in  ``{0: ['obj1'], 1: ['obj2', 'obj3'], ...}``, ``obj1`` is at rank 0, ``obj2`` and ``obj3`` are at rank 1, etc.
            
    **Attributes and Methods**:
    
    Attributes:
        in_nodes (dict[str, list[str]]): Dictionary with nodes as keys and a list of nodes that has incoming edges to the node indicated in the key.
        out_nodes (dict[str, list[str]]): Dictionary with nodes as keys and a list of nodes that has outgoing edges from the node indicated in the key.

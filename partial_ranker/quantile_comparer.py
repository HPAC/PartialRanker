class QuantileComparer:
    """
    Given a dictionary of objects consisting of a list of measurement values, e.g., ``{'obj1': [1.2, 1.3, 1.4], 'obj2': [1.5, 1.6, 1.7,0.9], ...}``, this class  
    provides methods to compare objects pairwise using a quantile-based better than relation, and to store the results 
    of the comparisons in a comparison matrix.
    
    Input:
        **measurements (dict[str, List[float]])**: A dictionary of objects consisting of a list of measurement values.
            
    **Attributes and Methods**:
    
    Attributes:
            
        C (dict[str, dict[str, int]]): A square matrix of size (N x N), where N is the number of objects.
            This matrix should holds the results of pair-wise comparisons as follows:
        
            - If ``obj_i`` is better than ``obj_j``, then ``C[obj_i][obj_j] = 0``.  
            - If ``obj_i`` is equivalent to ``obj_j``, then ``C[obj_i][obj_j] = 1``.
            - If ``obj_i`` is worse than ``obj_j``, then ``C[obj_i][obj_j] = 2``.  
        
        objs (list[str]): A list of object keys in the measurements dictionary.
        
            - e.g., ``['obj1', 'obj2', ...]``.
        
        t_up (dict[str, float]): A dictionary to store the upper quantile values of the measurements for each object.
        
            - e.g., ``{'obj1': 1.5, 'obj2': 1.6, ...}``.
        
        t_low (dict[str, float]): A dictionary to store the lower quantile values of the measurements for each object.

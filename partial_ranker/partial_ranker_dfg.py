    """DFG based partial ranking methodology (Methodology 1 in the paper).
    The ranks of an object corresponds to the depth of the object in a dependency graph which indicates the better-than relations. 
    The algorithm is implemented in the method ``compute_ranks()``.
    
    Input:
        comparer (partial_ranker.QuantileComparer):
            The ``QuantileComparer`` object that contains the results of pair-wise comparisons.
            i.e, ``comparer.compare()`` should have been called.
        
    **Attributes and Methods**:
    
    Attributes:
        dependencies (dict[str,list[str]]): A dictionary with objects as keys, whose value holds the list of objects that are better than the object indicated in the key. If ``obj_i`` is better than ``obj_j``, then the value of ``obj_j`` in the dictionary is a list containing ``obj_i``.
        
            - e.g.; in the dict ``{'obj1': ['obj2', 'obj3], 'obj2': ['obj4'], ...}``, ``obj2`` and ``obj3`` are better than ``obj1``, ``obj4`` is better than ``obj2``, etc.

    First, the partial ranking is computed using Methodology 1. Then, the dependency graph from Methodology 1 is used to identify an alternative partial ranking with fewer ranks.
    The algorithm is implemented in the method ``compute_ranks()``.
    
    Input:
        comparer (partial_ranker.QuantileComparer):
            The ``QuantileComparer`` object that contains the results of pair-wise comparisons.
            i.e, ``comparer.compare()`` should have been called.
        
    **Attributes and Methods**:
    
    Attributes:
        objs (List[str]): List of object names.
        pr_dfg (partial_ranker.PartialRankerDFG): The partial ranking object which computes a parial ranking according to Methodology 1.
        graph_H (partial_ranker.Graph): The dependency graph that represents the rank relation among the objects according to Methodology 1.

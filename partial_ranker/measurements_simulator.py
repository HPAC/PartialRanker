class MeasurementsSimulator:
    """
    Class for simulating measurements values using a normal distribution. Given a dictionary with object IDs as keys, and [mean, std] as values,
    measurement values are generated and stored.

    Inputs:
        **obj_params (dict[str,List[float]])**: Keys are object IDs (str) whose value indicates the mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution represented as [mean, std].            
        
            - e.g., for noramal distribution, ``{'obj1': [1.0, 0.1], 'obj2': [2.0, 0.2], ...}``, the mean and std are 1.0 and 0.1 for object 'obj1', and 2.0 and 0.2 for object 'obj2'.        
        
        **seed (int)**: The numpy seed used to generate measurements. Defaults to 0.
        
    **Attributes and Methods**:
    
    Attributes:
        measurements (dict[str,List[float]]): A dictionary to store measurements. Keys are object IDs (str), and values are lists of measurement values.
        
            - e.g., ``{'obj1': [1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 'obj2': [4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 9.0], ...}``

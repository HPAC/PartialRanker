class PartialRankerMin:
    """Partial ranking methodology (Methodology 3 in the paper). 
    First, the objects are grouped into mutually exclusive equivalence classes based on the results of pair-wise comparisons.
    Then, the equivalence classes are ranked according to increasing lower quantiles values of one of the objects each class.
    All the objects in an equivalence class are ranked equally.
    The algorithm is implemented in the method ``compute_ranks()``.
    
    Input:
        comparer (partial_ranker.QuantileComparer):
            The ``QuantileComparer`` object that contains the results of pair-wise comparisons.
            i.e, ``comparer.compare()`` should have been called.
        
    **Attributes and Methods**:
    
    Attributes:
        objs (List[str]): List of object names.
        
        equivalence (dict[str,list[str]]): A dictionary with objects as keys, whose value holds the list of objects that are equivalent to the object indicated in the key. 
        
            - e.g.; in the dict ``{'obj1': ['obj3', 'obj4], 'obj2': ['obj5'], ...}``, ``obj3`` and ``obj4`` are equivalent to ``obj1``, ``obj5`` is equivalent to ``obj2``, etc.
